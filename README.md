# Modelling the Weight-of-Honey-bee-hive-

This repository contains the implementation of the model and data=analysis methods proposed in Ref. [1] to study the variation of the weight of honey bee hives within a day. 

## Usage

The jupyter notebooks in the root file of the repository allow you to explore the results:
- Tutorial1: Simple tutorial to explore the model and to estimate its parameters from data. 
- Tutorial2: A more detailed tutorial.
- Table 2: shows results for different datasets and reproduces the results presented in Table 2 of Ref. [1]
- Figure 3a: explores the different regimes of the model and reproduces the results presented in Fig. 3a of Ref. [1]

## Folders

- src: source codes, in the file "source_codes.py"
- data: ten data sets of weight vs. time, registered for ten different hives on the 7th of April, 2018.
